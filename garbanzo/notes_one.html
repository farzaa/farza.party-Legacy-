                - After Stanford, he went back and used to audit different classes like the Unity class and deep learning class. He tinkered a lot and made a lot of stuff. For really no reason. Just for fun.
            </div>
            <div class="subSection">- In the early phase, the most important thing to do is to is to distill the problem down to the easiest thing you can make/do.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Insta distilled their problem in 2010 like so: photos take forever to upload so lets make it faster, lets make the photos look better, and lets make it really easy to share photos across multiple networks. </div>
            <div class="subSection">- The easiest trap to fall into would be where you start solving 5-10 smaller problems instead of the 1-2 massive problems. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Insta made this mistake in the first 6 months of the company’s history w/ Burbn.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Insta does this amazingly well now. They stay true to the original problems they set out to solve and haven’t changed much. Even at Facebook, he aggressively says no to random "would be cool" features.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Instagram was extremely founder driven. The two founders were essentially controlling everything and had the final yes/no.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- You need to set high level goals and put that stake in the ground. Don’t flop around. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Didn’t have any real process in the early stages. Planning was a bulleted list of extremely important problems to solve every week. Would solve those problems, ship it, and see how it went. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Built the early version of Instagram and beta’d it while working on another product (Burbn).</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Built Instagram in 4.5 month.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Hired some of his first people from HN comment threads. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Never did whiteboard interviews. Usually people came in for 4 hours and were given some coding task and working a bit w/ the team.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Hiring great designers was never a problem. Engineers were hard because early Insta was tough to build. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Longest time he was ever office was a 12 hour flight to Brazil. He got home and had two emails, one saying “Instagram is down” and one say “Everything is okay!”.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Was coding on Insta until 2018. Has been hacking on stuff since he started the company.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- It’s very rare that co-founders to get along for a long time. Insta is insane, 8 years together. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">Audience Q/A</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- There was a lot of competing products when Insta came out. How did Insta win?</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- There were a lot of dead photo apps. So they looked at a lot of the issues and one the biggest issues was: it’s really hard to find people on the apps to follow. They also streamlined making photos look good so anyone could do it. They also made it really easy to share stuff outside the platform via a link where you could see the post without having Insta via a web app. Allowed people to post on Insta and Facebook at the same time. There was a natural path to virality and they had it built in Day 1. Thats what made them different. </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Whats changed about you and your personality?</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Got the ability to remain calm even when shit was breaking. Learned to get comfortable with doing stuff he was not comfortable with. His team also constantly asked him really hard questions. And he had to answer them. He got really good at representing the company and managing.</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- What happen during Instagrams first month?</div> 
            <div class="subSection">- Pro photographers hated Insta. But a lot of people were really into photography but not pro: they were designers. They seeded the community by going to Dribble and emailed the top designers to try the app. People would post to their Twitter the weblink to Instagram posts. The mailing list of people interested was in the 1000s. Made the Tesflight pretty exclusive and seeded it with influencers. Learned a lot about their own product just by watching people use it.  </div> 
            <div class="subSection">- How did you decide to switch to Insta from Burbn?</div>
            <div class="subSection">- Burbn just didn’t grow from January to August. But they kept convincing themselves that it could grow. It didn’t do anything really great. It just did a lot of stuff. Would go to random bars and pitch to random people to talk about the product and that really helped them pitch it to people. Your product needs to be understandable by a friend in a loud bar. In the end, Insta had growth. Burbn didn't. </div>
