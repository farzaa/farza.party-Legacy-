                Song: I Wish I Could Start Over

            We all listen to music for different reasons, but it's almost always because we want to 
            feel something.
            That feeling could be anything: happiness, excitement, sadness, etc. On his track
            I Wish I Could Start Over", King Theta puts his audience into this very 
            somber yet reflective mood as he lyricizes about death and desolation.
        </div>

        <div class="subSection">
            The track begins with a faint guitar riff that makes the listener 
            feel as if they have their ear to a concrete wall trying to make out 
            a sound, where on the other side the artist
            is playing the riff.

            It was this intense curiosity that had me extremely invested in the song
            just 6 seconds in. 
        </div>

        <div class="subSection">
            The muffled, melancholic riff becomes clearer when the opener 
            transitions to King Theta singing over it. His vocal style isn't
            good in the traditional sense. He isn't hitting notes like Adele or singing 
            with beautiful melodies like Frank Ocean. But, he doesn't have to. His vocal style is 
            extremely raw, brutally honest, and oddly addicting. 
            From the first lyric where he gloomily sings "I just wanna feel like I could fly",
            I was immediately put into this extremely somber and reflective mood. 
        </div>

        <div class="subSection">
            The core theme of this track is King Theta's obsession with his own 
            desolation and destruction. He screams lyrics like "shit's gonna cave in soon" and 
            "if I die do I get a fresh start". He's fighting between giving up on life and 
            continuing the fight as he beckons for any bit of support he can grab 
            with lyrics like "Baby, tell me imma be a star" and "save me, think I'm gonna fall apart".    
        </div>

        <div class="subSection">
            The most interesting part about this track for me is that King Theta 
            constantly sings about his personal confidence but really how this is all just a facade
            for how broken he actually feels inside. Lyrics like "I swear to fuckin God I'm doin' fine"
            and "Sorry, not sorry for my ego" constantly clash with "I need to fill the void in my heart" and 
            "Hate me so I can stay in the dark". It reminds me of myself and many of my friends in lots 
            ways, where we're extremely 
            proud and push people away - but there is fair bit of tragedy wrapped up under many layers. King Theta surfaces
            that sort of tragedy on this track.
        </div>

        <div class="subSection">
            King Theta's powerful singing is complemented beautifully by an extremely addictive
            beat that can best be described as punk rock/alternative rock meets a modern-day 
            trap rap beat. It's extremely reminiscent of beats that the late Lil Peep used on 
            tracks that made him a superstar. I think many would actually say that King Theta 
            sounds a lot like Lil Peep or Juice Wrld who both popularized this style of modern 
            "emo" music with hip hop elements. But, I think King Theta is very much forging his 
            own path. I've been listening to the "emo" genre (or whatever we want to call it) 
            for many years now and have a heard a lot of cookie cutter musicians who take a trap
            beat, write some "sad" lyrics, and record the track with some nasally vocals.

        <div class="subSection">
            King Theta is more than that. He beautifully crafts these melodramatic lyrics, sings them
            with real passion, and wraps up the package with a beat that matches the power of his vocals.
